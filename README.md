### Hello there!

I'm a [**research software engineer**](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) specializing in:
* 🗺 spatial analysis
* 🤔 decisions support applications
* ⬆ and optimization modeling

especially for water, environmental, and agricultural questions in California and the western United States.

In support of this, I do **full stack engineering** with skills including:
* 📀🐍 Software engineering in Python, Javascript (HTML + CSS, etc too), R, Perl, and more, with expertise with numerous frameworks and libraries;
* 🖥 DevOps with server provisioning and security
* 📊 Data visualization with interactive and static graphics
* 🗺 Spatial analysis, visualization, and teaching in both open source and proprietary toolchains
* 📁 ETL pipelines and data management for research and applications too small for large data management platforms.
