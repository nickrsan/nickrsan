### Hello there!

I'm a research software engineer specializing in spatial analysis, decisions support applications, and optimization modeling, especially for water, environmental, and agricultural questions in California and the western United States.

In support of this, I do full stack engineering with skills including:
* Software engineering in Python, Javascript (HTML + CSS, etc too), R, Perl, and more, with expertise with numerous frameworks and libraries;
* DevOps with server provisioning and security
* Data visualization with interactive and static graphics
* Spatial analysis, visualization, and teaching in both open source and proprietary toolchains
* ETL pipelines and data management for research and applications too small for large data management platforms.
